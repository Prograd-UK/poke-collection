# Pok√©mon Collection App

Welcome to the **Pok√©mon Collection App**! This is a base application designed for a technical challenge where you'll extend the app by implementing new features. The app allows users to browse Pok√©mon, like them, add them to collections, and leave comments. Authentication is handled via Clerk.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: v20 or higher
- **pnpm**: Package manager used for managing dependencies and scripts

## Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework for building the frontend and API routes.
- **TypeScript**: Statically typed JavaScript for writing type-safe code.
- **SQLite**: Simple, lightweight database used via Prisma ORM.
- **Prisma**: Next-generation ORM for interacting with the SQLite database.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository to create your own copy of the project.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/poke-collection.git
   cd poke-collection
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Create your local `.env` file**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Replace placeholder Clerk keys values:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_123
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_123
   ```

5. **Run the Application Locally**
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

The application will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Features

The base application includes the following features:

- **Authentication via Clerk**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their sessions.
- **Browse Pok√©mon**: View a list of Pok√©mon fetched from an external API and stored in a SQLite database.
- **Like Pok√©mon**: Users can like Pok√©mon and see the like count.
- **Create Collections**: Users can create personal collections to organize their favorite Pok√©mon.
- **Add Pok√©mon to Collections**: Users can add specific Pok√©mon to their created collections.
- **Comment on Pok√©mon**: Users can leave comments on individual Pok√©mon.
